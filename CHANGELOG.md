# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.9.0] - 2026-08-24

### ✨ Added

- **Account timezone and today's date on list responses**: task-list responses (`list`, `list_all_uncompleted`) and schedule responses now begin with a one-line header, e.g. `Account timezone: America/Denver | Today: 2026-08-24 (Monday)`. Date-relative reasoning the model does itself (weekday, "now") previously had nothing in the payload naming the account's zone, so fresh agents inferred "now" from the newest `updatedTime` and sometimes reported the wrong day. The zone is already resolved for rendering, so this adds no API calls, and it lands on both the stdio and Worker entry points. (#151, closes #150)
- **`list_all_uncompleted` honors `dueDate` and `priority`**: these were on the shared `motion_tasks` schema but silently dropped, so "due this week across all workspaces" returned everything. Both filters are now threaded (dueDate validated in the account zone) through the per-workspace queries. (#149)
- **`list` gains `completedAfter` / `completedBefore`**: Motion has no server-side completion-date filter, so "what did I get done this week?" meant dumping all statuses and filtering by hand. These client-side day-granularity bounds (account zone, both inclusive) auto-imply `includeAllStatuses`; a very large window stays bounded by `MAX_PAGES` and surfaces in truncation metadata rather than truncating silently. (#149)
- **Schedule responses print each day's working hours**: `formatScheduleList` now shows the start-end times per day instead of only a working-days count, so "when am I free?" can anchor to real hours. The times were already in the payload. The tool description notes these are recurring working-hour templates only and do not expose calendar events or meetings. (#149)
- **`motion_statuses` moved into the `essential` tier** (now 8 tools), so marking a task done can look up the workspace's resolved status name instead of guessing it. (#149)
- **Cloudflare Worker observability enabled**: `wrangler.toml` now turns on Workers logs, so invocations are traceable in the Cloudflare dashboard for debugging.

### 🔒 Security

- **Fixed fail-open authentication in the Cloudflare Worker (critical)**: when `MOTION_MCP_SECRET` was unset, the path-secret check compared `undefined !== undefined` and authorized every request, exposing unauthenticated MCP access to the Motion account. The Worker now fails closed with a 500. (#132)
- **Closed an authentication bypass on the SSE message endpoint (critical)**: `POST /mcp/message?sessionId=...` was forwarded to `McpAgent` with no credential check. The agents SDK instantiates a Durable Object for any `sessionId` without verifying the id was issued on a secret-authenticated stream, so this route could invoke tools without the secret. It is now authenticated like every other route. (#132)
- **Constant-time secret comparison**: secrets are compared as SHA-256 digests via `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual` rather than with `!==`. (#132)
- **`Authorization: Bearer <secret>` support**: the recommended way to authenticate, keeping the secret out of the URL. The existing `/mcp/SECRET/...` path secret remains supported as a backward-compatible fallback, and the scheme name is matched case-insensitively per RFC 7235. (#132)
- **Worker tool schemas are now strict**: tools are registered with the full `ZodObject` via `registerTool` instead of the raw shape via `tool()`, which had discarded `additionalProperties: false` and silently stripped unknown properties. (#132)
- **The raw secret no longer travels in the legacy-SSE message query string**: path-secret clients previously echoed `MOTION_MCP_SECRET` in an `mcpSecret` query parameter on every message POST, landing the long-lived secret in access and proxy logs. The Worker now mints an expiring HMAC session credential (signed over its issue time with `MOTION_MCP_SECRET`, verified statelessly) at stream open and threads it through an `mcpSession` parameter instead. A leaked credential expires after 24 hours where a leaked shared secret never would; the raw secret in the parameter is now rejected, closing the downgrade. The TTL must outlast a session (the credential is minted once per stream), so the gain is eventual expiry, not a short window. (#135)

> **Note for path-secret + legacy SSE users**: the message endpoint is authenticated by an expiring `mcpSession` credential the server mints and the client echoes back, so the raw secret no longer appears in query strings. Bearer clients authenticate with the header and receive no credential parameter. `Authorization: Bearer` remains the recommended mode.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`dueDate` filter dropped same-day tasks for accounts west of UTC**: `list` compared each task's raw UTC date against a local calendar filter value. A task due end-of-day local time is stored as a UTC instant on the *next* calendar day, so it sorted after "today" and was silently dropped from "what's due today?" even though its display (rendered in the account zone) showed the correct day. Each task's `dueDate` is now reduced to a calendar date in the account timezone before comparing (new `calendarDateInZone` helper), falling back to the UTC date portion when no zone is resolvable. The `dueDate` filter is also now documented as an inclusive on-or-before-day bound that includes overdue tasks. (#148)
- **Assignee names resolved against the wrong workspace**: `move` and `update` resolved an assignee name through a cross-workspace search that returned the first match found, so a name held by users in two workspaces could reassign a task to the wrong person. Resolution is now scoped to the destination workspace on `move` and to the task's own workspace on `update`. (#132)
- **`assignee` name and the `me` shortcut were dropped**: both were silently discarded or forwarded literally on task create/update/move, and `me` was unresolved on recurring task creation. (#132)
- **`sanitize` deleted ordinary text**: the tag-stripping regex removed any `<...>` span, so text like `x < 5 and y > 3` lost content. It is now anchored to real HTML tag names. (#132)
- **Oversized pages dropped items**: pagination sliced a page exceeding `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` and then advanced the cursor, silently discarding the remainder. It now stops and reports the count actually returned instead of `0`. (#132)
- **Truncated result sets were cached as complete**: projects and recurring tasks cached items without the truncation metadata, so a later hit returned a partial list as if whole. Truncated results are no longer cached, and the recurring-tasks cache key now includes `limit`/`maxPages`. (#132)
- **Search missed matches past the first page**: client-side filtering only saw ~100 items per workspace. It now overfetches up to `MAX_SEARCH_FETCH`. (#132)
- **Invalid calendar dates were accepted**: `Date.UTC` normalizes overflow, so `2026-02-31` became March 3 and was sent to the API as a date the caller never requested. `parseFilterDate` now rejects dates that do not round-trip. (#132)
- **Date-only due dates shifted a day east of UTC**: they are now stored at local end-of-day in the resolved time zone. (#132)
- **Multi-day monthly/quarterly recurrence silently discarded days**: unsupported `weekOfMonth` combinations are now rejected with an explanatory error; an all-seven-days set maps losslessly to the any-day pattern. (#132)
- **Validator mutated caller arguments**: AJV's `coerceTypes` rewrote the input object in place. Validation now runs against a clone, and handlers receive the coerced values. (#132)
- **A duplicate name in `MOTION_MCP_TOOLS=custom:...` crashed Worker startup**: the custom tool list is de-duplicated. (#132)
- **Empty select `options` were accepted** when creating a custom field, and recurring task `duration` was unvalidated. Both are now rejected, with matching schema constraints (`minItems: 1`, `minimum: 0`). (#132)
- **`structuredContent` omitted fields the text output shows**: `taskToStructuredContent` now projects `duration`, `deadlineType`, and `labels`, so machine consumers see the same task fields human readers do. `duration` is projected directly rather than summed from `chunks`, which read `0` for exactly the unschedulable tasks (`schedulingIssue: true`, `chunks: []`) an at-risk report exists to surface. (#140)
- **CORS preflight was rejected on `/mcp` (Bearer mode) and `/mcp/message`**: the auth gate answered `OPTIONS` with a 404, but browsers send preflights without credentials, so browser-origin MCP clients could not use Bearer mode or the legacy SSE message endpoint at all. Preflights under `/mcp` are now answered before the gate with the same CORS headers the agents SDK emits; every non-`OPTIONS` request stays fully gated. (#138)
- **Path-secret SSE sub-paths dead-ended in a confusing SDK 404**: `/mcp/<secret>/sse` (and any path-secret sub-path other than `/mcp/<secret>/message`) was rewritten and forwarded only to 404 inside the agents SDK, which matches the legacy stream on `/mcp` alone. The Worker now rejects these with a clean 404 before attaching the secret, so the long-lived secret no longer lands on a dead-end URL where a Durable Object exception could surface it in Workers trace events. The supported path-secret address is `/mcp/<SECRET>`; the server advertises its own sub-paths during a session. (#141)

### 🛠️ API Changes

- `motion_statuses` accepts `operation` and `workspaceName` (with name resolution), matching the other tools. (#132)
- All 10 tool schemas set `additionalProperties: false`, so unknown properties are rejected rather than ignored. Note this makes the previously undocumented `entityTypes` property on `motion_search` an error; use `searchScope`. (#132)
- **Empty assignee identifiers are rejected**: `assigneeId` and `assignee` on `motion_tasks`, and `assigneeId` on `motion_recurring_tasks`, now carry `minLength: 1`. An empty string previously reached the handler and was silently dropped, so `update` appeared to succeed while changing nothing. Callers now get a validation error; use the `unassign` operation to clear a task's assignee. (#132)

### 📦 Dependencies

- **@hono/node-server**: 1.19.13 → 2.1.1, resolving Dependabot alert #149 (GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9, path traversal in `serve-static` on Windows). Lockfile-only; the package is a transitive dependency of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and is never imported by either entry point. (#134)
- **Minimum Node.js is now 20** (was 18). Node 18 reached end of life in April 2025, and `@hono/node-server` 2.x declares `engines.node: ">=20"`, so installs on Node 18 emitted `EBADENGINE` warnings. Development targets Node 24, pinned in `mise.toml`.

### 🧪 Testing

- Added regression coverage for assignee resolution and workspace scoping, sanitize tag anchoring, frequency transforms, duration parsing, validator cloning/coercion, custom tool de-duplication, and status/search/custom-field/recurring handler paths. 539 tests across 30 files.
- **`src/worker.ts` auth is now covered under workerd**: a `worker` Vitest project runs the auth path inside `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, so `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual`, the real `Request`/`URL` rewrite semantics, and the Durable Object bindings are exercised in the same runtime as production. (#139)
- Covered four implemented-but-untested paths surfaced by the #132 review: `jsonSchemaToZodObject` strictness (rejects unknown keys; enforces `minLength`, `minimum: 0`, `minItems: 1`), `fetchAllPages` truncation (oversized-page stop without cursor advance, accurate `returnedCount`, `max_items` precedence, `max_pages` ceiling), the `workspaceResolver` ambiguous case-insensitive-match warning, and `endOfDayInZone` across DST transitions in both hemispheres plus a fixed-offset control. (#136)
- **`npm run test:types` was failing**: `tsconfig.tests.json` type-checked `src/utils/sessionCredential.ts`, which uses workerd-only APIs (`CryptoKey`, `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual`) unavailable under the Node libs of that config. It is now excluded there, matching `tsconfig.json`; the file stays type-checked under Workers types via `tests/worker/tsconfig.json`.
- **Integration tests silently skipped even with a key set**: `vitest.integration.config.ts` never loaded `.env`, so the `describe.skip` guard saw no `MOTION_API_KEY` and skipped all 26 tests while exiting 0. The config now loads `.env` via a `dotenv/config` setup file.
- **Added a CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs the type-checks, build, and the node + worker test suites on every push to `main` and every pull request. It runs on Node 24 (the workerd test project requires Node >= 22); integration tests are excluded as they need a live API key.

### 📖 Documentation

- **DEVELOPER.md listed the wrong default tool tier**: it labeled `essential` as the default, but the stdio server defaults to `complete` (10 tools). Corrected the tier list to match the code, README, and CLAUDE.md, with the tool counts each tier adds.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-02

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Hardened object/array parameters against LLM stringification**: Some MCP transports serialize structured parameters as JSON strings (e.g., `'{"type":"weekly"}'` instead of `{"type":"weekly"}`). Added defensive parsing with `parseObjectParam()` and `parseArrayParam()` utilities that transparently handle both native and stringified inputs. Applied to: (#88, #89)
  - `autoScheduled` parameter in task create/update (fixed in PR #89)
  - `frequency` object in recurring task creation
  - `status` array in task list filtering
  - `value` array for multiSelect custom fields

### 📖 Documentation

- **Fixed stale README tool descriptions**: Corrected `motion_search` operations (only `content` exists; removed references to deleted `context` and `smart` operations) and `motion_workspaces` operations (removed non-existent `set_default`).

### 📦 Dependencies

- **hono**: 4.12.1 → 4.12.2 (#86)
- **rollup**: 4.57.1 → 4.59.0 (#87)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### 🏗️ Refactoring

- **Split `motionApi.ts` into resource modules**: Decomposed the monolithic 1,850-line `MotionApiService` into 10 focused resource modules under `src/services/api/`. The facade class (`motionApi.ts`) is now ~254 lines of pure delegation with no business logic. Each module exports standalone async functions that accept a `ResourceContext` (`{ api, cache }`), making the codebase easier to navigate, test, and extend. (#52, #85)
  - New modules: `tasks`, `projects`, `workspaces`, `users`, `comments`, `customFields`, `recurringTasks`, `schedules`, `search`, `statuses`
  - Extracted `ApiClient` (HTTP client with retry/backoff) and `CacheManager` (per-resource TTL cache) as shared infrastructure
  - Shared types in `src/services/api/types.ts` (`ResourceContext`, `IApiClient`, `ICacheManager`)
  - Barrel export at `src/services/api/index.ts`
  - Added `facade-contract.spec.ts` — 314-line test suite verifying the facade delegates correctly to all resource modules

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Consolidated error modules**: Merged separate error files into a single `errors.ts` module. (#81)
- **Dead code removal**: Removed unused exports, stubs, and consolidated scattered constants. (#78)
- **`UserFacingError` statusCode parameter**: Added an explicit `statusCode` constructor parameter for cleaner error construction. (#83)
- **`ToolRegistry.register()` made private**: Encapsulated tool registration as an internal implementation detail. (#79, #84)

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-24

### 🚀 New Features

- **Auto-generated tool argument types**: New `scripts/generate-types.ts` derives `mcp-tool-args.ts` from JSON Schema definitions, eliminating manual type maintenance and ensuring handler argument types always match tool schemas. (#76)
- **Integration test suite**: Added real-API integration tests (`api-contracts.integration.test.ts`, `enum-values.integration.test.ts`) that verify response shapes, enum casing, and parameter semantics against the live Motion API. Skipped gracefully when `MOTION_API_KEY` is absent.
- **Client-side-filter-aware truncation notices**: When priority or due-date filtering is applied client-side after paginated fetching, the truncation notice now accurately reports the post-filter count and warns that matching tasks may exist on unfetched pages.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **API alignment**: Corrected Motion API call patterns, parameter naming, and response handling to match official documentation — including custom field endpoints, task search, and pagination cursor handling.
- **Custom field `valueId` exposure**: The `add_to_task` / `add_to_project` responses now surface the `valueId` needed for subsequent removal operations.
- **`autoScheduled` validation on update**: Task updates now validate `autoScheduled` parameters (schedule name, deadline type) the same way task creation does.
- **Integration test cleanup**: Removed incorrect `removeCustomFieldFromTask` calls that passed a field definition ID where a value assignment ID was expected; task deletion handles cleanup.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Dead code removal**: Removed unused stubs, placeholder comments, `validateArgs`/`ValidationResult` from handler base, and legacy search operations (`context`, `smart`).
- **Hardened types and validation**: Strengthened TypeScript types across Motion API types, handler arguments, and service methods; improved runtime validation for priorities, durations, frequencies, and custom field operations.
- **Parameter and caching fixes**: Corrected parameter naming inconsistencies, cache key construction, and log levels throughout the service layer.
- **Response formatting improvements**: Enriched recurring task and schedule formatters with full object details; improved workspace resolver fuzzy matching.

### 📖 Documentation

- Condensed CLAUDE.md to remove duplication, updated tool default references to `complete`.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### 🚀 New Features

- **Default tool configuration changed to `complete`**: All 10 tools are now enabled by default. With only 10 consolidated tools and MCP clients supporting deferred tool loading, gating 3 useful tools behind opt-in provided no practical benefit. Users who explicitly set `MOTION_MCP_TOOLS` are unaffected. (#71, #73)
- **MCP server instructions for tool discovery**: Both entry points (stdio and Cloudflare Worker) now include a keyword-rich `instructions` string in the MCP handshake, improving tool discoverability for clients that support `defer_loading` or tool search.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Handler test mock shape mismatch**: Fixed 4 handler test files where mocks returned plain arrays instead of `ListResult<T>` objects (`{ items, truncation }`), matching the refactored service method signatures. (#74, #75)
- **`.env.example` default inconsistency**: Updated `.env.example` to reflect the new `complete` default instead of actively setting `essential`.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Version strings synced to 2.5.0**: Both `mcp-server.ts` and `worker.ts` now match `package.json`.
- **Shared constants**: Added `src/constants.ts` with `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` used by both entry points.

### 📖 Documentation

- Updated README tool configuration section: reframed from "tool limits" to "reducing tool noise", marked `complete` as default, removed `MOTION_MCP_TOOLS` from primary setup examples.
- Updated CLAUDE.md default reference from `essential` to `complete`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### 🚀 New Features

- **Cloudflare Workers remote MCP server**: Added a new entry point (`src/worker.ts`) that runs the MCP server as a Cloudflare Worker using Streamable HTTP/SSE transport. This enables access from mobile and web clients (Claude mobile, claude.ai, ChatGPT) without requiring a local stdio process. Uses `McpAgent` from the Cloudflare Agents SDK with Durable Objects for per-session state. Auth is handled via a secret token embedded in the URL path. (#60)
  - New `wrangler.toml` configuration and `tsconfig.worker.json` for Worker builds
  - `jsonSchemaToZod.ts` utility converts JSON Schema tool definitions to Zod schemas (required by `McpServer.tool()`) using Zod v4's `fromJSONSchema()`
  - Deploy via `npm run worker:deploy` or the one-click "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" button in the README

- **Multi-status filtering for task listing**: The `motion_tasks` list operation now accepts `status` as an array of strings, enabling filtering by multiple statuses in a single request (e.g., `status: ["Todo", "In Progress"]`). Repeated `status=` query parameters are sent to the Motion API, which returns the union of matching tasks. (#68, #69)
  - New `includeAllStatuses` boolean parameter to retrieve tasks in all statuses (including completed/canceled)
  - Validation prevents combining `status` filter with `includeAllStatuses`
  - Per-element validation ensures status arrays contain only non-empty strings
  - Status values are deduplicated before sending to the API
  - Fully backward compatible — single string `status` values work as before

### 📖 Documentation

- Restructured README for clarity: consolidated overlapping tool sections into a single Tools Reference, reorganized API key setup and advanced configuration
- Added "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" button to README
- Updated CLAUDE.md and DEVELOPER.md with Cloudflare Worker architecture details, development workflow, and deployment instructions

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-19

### 🚀 New Features

- **Truncation notices for MCP clients**: When paginated API responses are incomplete, MCP clients now receive a human-readable `Note:` in the response explaining that results were limited and suggesting filters to narrow results. Previously, truncation warnings only appeared in stderr logs, leaving LLMs unaware when data was incomplete. (#54, #62)
  - New `TruncationInfo` and `ListResult<T>` types propagate truncation metadata from the pagination layer through services to formatters
  - Three truncation reasons tracked: `page_size_limit`, `max_items`, `max_pages`
  - Notices follow the existing `\n\nNote:` response pattern

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Truncation aggregation in multi-workspace methods**: Fixed a bug where iterating multiple workspaces would overwrite earlier truncation info with later results. If workspace A was truncated but workspace B was not, the truncation notice could be lost. Now the first truncation is preserved across `getAllProjects`, `searchTasks`, `searchProjects`, and `getAllUncompletedTasks`.
- **Stale truncation notices from cache**: `projectCache` and `recurringTaskCache` no longer store truncation metadata. Previously, cached `ListResult<T>` values could serve stale "there may be more items" notices after the underlying data changed. Cache now stores only item arrays; truncation is only reported on fresh fetches.
- **SearchHandler combined truncation mismatch**: When both task and project searches returned truncated results, only the last search's truncation was preserved. Now the first truncation is kept, and when combined results exceed the limit after slicing, a proper `max_items` truncation is reported.
- **`getAllProjects` returnedCount underreported**: The `returnedCount` in aggregate truncation was captured mid-loop when the first truncation was encountered, but subsequent workspaces kept adding items. Added a final count update before returning, matching the pattern in `searchTasks`/`searchProjects`.
- **dotenv v17 stdout pollution**: Restored `quiet: true` in `dotenv.config()` to suppress the stdout banner that dotenv v17 writes by default. This banner was corrupting the MCP JSON-RPC stdio transport.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Formatter refactoring**: `formatTaskList`, `formatSearchResults`, and `formatRecurringTaskList` no longer mutate `CallToolResult` content arrays with type assertions. They now build text strings first and pass to `formatMcpSuccess`, matching the pattern used by `formatProjectList`.

### 📦 Dependencies

- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk**: 1.25.3 → 1.26.0 (security fix for cross-client data leak)
- **axios**: 1.13.4 → 1.13.5 (security fix for DoS via `__proto__` key)
- **qs**: 6.14.1 → 6.14.2 (security fix for arrayLimit bypass)
- **ajv**: 8.17.1 → 8.18.0 (security fix for ReDoS)
- **dotenv**: 17.2.3 → 17.3.1
- **@types/node**: 24.10.10 → 24.10.13

### 🧪 Testing

- **Regression test**: Added `stdio-safety.spec.ts` to prevent the dotenv `quiet: true` flag from being removed again.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-02-18

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **MCP stdio transport corruption**: Restored `quiet: true` in `dotenv.config()` to suppress the stdout banner that dotenv v17 writes by default. This banner (`[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env...`) was corrupting the MCP JSON-RPC stdio transport, causing `"not valid JSON"` parse errors in MCP clients like Claude Desktop. The flag was originally added in 2.2.2 but accidentally removed in 2.2.3.

### 🧪 Testing

- **Regression test**: Added `stdio-safety.spec.ts` with source-code and runtime assertions to prevent the `quiet: true` flag from being removed again.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-02-18

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Assignee filtering for list_all_uncompleted**: The `list_all_uncompleted` operation now supports `assignee` and `assigneeId` parameters, including the `'me'` shortcut. Previously these were silently ignored, returning all users' tasks instead of the requested assignee's tasks. (#58, closes #59)
- **dotenv config**: Removed `quiet: true` option from `dotenv.config()` — this was a mistake; see 2.2.4 fix

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Shared assignee resolution**: Extracted duplicated assignee resolution logic from `handleList` and `handleListAllUncompleted` into a reusable `resolveAssignee()` private method. Supports single-workspace and cross-workspace name lookups via an optional `workspaceId` parameter.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-03

### 📦 Dependencies

- **dotenv**: Upgraded from v16 to v17.2.3
- **@types/node**: Updated to 24.10.10

## [2.1.1] - 2025-09-21

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Due Date Normalization
- **Fixed Due Date Display Issue**: Resolved bug where due dates appeared one day early in some timezones
- **Added `normalizeDueDateForApi` Utility**: New function that normalizes date-only strings to end-of-day UTC timestamps
- **Consistent Date Handling**: Applied normalization to both task creation and task updates
- **Preserved Timezone Data**: Existing timestamps with timezone offsets remain unchanged

#### Implementation Details

- Relative dates (`today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`) are properly normalized to end-of-day UTC
- Timestamps with explicit timezone offsets are preserved unchanged
- Enhanced tool documentation to clarify date normalization behavior

#### Testing & Validation
- Added comprehensive test coverage for date normalization scenarios
- Verified edge case handling (null, undefined, invalid dates)
- Updated task handler tests to verify normalization is applied

- **Test Coverage**: Updated test suite for new API signatures
- **Documentation**: Enhanced inline documentation and parameter descriptions

### 🛠️ API Changes

#### New `motion_tasks` Parameters
```json
{
  "operation": "list",
  "assignee": "john@company.com",     // New: Name, email, or "me"
  "priority": "HIGH",                 // New: ASAP, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
  "dueDate": "today",                // New: YYYY-MM-DD or relative
  "labels": ["urgent", "frontend"]    // New: Array of label names
}
```

#### Enhanced Response Format
Task list responses now include filter context:
```
Tasks in workspace "Development" for assignee "John Doe" with priority "HIGH" due by 09/16/2025 (limit: 10)
```

### 🔄 Breaking Changes
- None - All changes are backward compatible

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed cache TTL inconsistencies that could cause unexpectedly long cache lifetimes
- Resolved text sanitization issues that over-escaped user content
- Fixed duplicate property declarations in TypeScript definitions

### 📈 Performance Impact
- **Reduced API Calls**: More efficient filtering reduces unnecessary data transfer
- **Improved Caching**: Consistent cache behavior improves response times
- **Better Memory Usage**: Optimized cache cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 🔧 Developer Experience

#### New Validation Helpers
```typescript
// Available in src/utils/constants.ts
isValidPriority(priority: string): boolean
parseFilterDate(dateInput: string): string | null
```

#### Enhanced Error Codes
```typescript
ERROR_CODES.INVALID_PRIORITY
ERROR_CODES.INVALID_DATE_FORMAT
```

### 📚 Usage Examples

#### Filter by Assignee
```json
{
  "operation": "list",
  "assignee": "me",
  "workspaceName": "Development"
}
```

#### Filter by Multiple Criteria
```json
{
  "operation": "list",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "dueDate": "2025-09-20",
  "labels": ["urgent", "bug"],
  "projectName": "Web App"
}
```

#### Relative Date Filtering
```json
{
  "operation": "list",
  "dueDate": "tomorrow",
  "status": "TODO"
}
```

### 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements
- **Handler-Based Validation**: Centralized parameter validation in TaskHandler
- **Type-Safe API**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new filter parameters in the future

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Update to version 2.1.0
2. Use new filter parameters in your `motion_tasks` calls
3. Enjoy enhanced task discovery and management capabilities

### 📋 Migration Guide
No migration required - all existing code continues to work unchanged. New filter parameters are optional and can be added incrementally.

### 🙏 Acknowledgments
This release focuses on user-requested task filtering capabilities while maintaining the robust, type-safe architecture that makes Motion MCP Server reliable for production use.
